### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a C#/.NET developer creating software for manufacturing and quality management.  
Most of my work is done in enterprise environments and lives in private repositories, but I love working with:

- 🖥️ WinForms, Blazor, .NET MAUI
- 🧠 C# & SQL Server for backend logic
- 🧩 Syncfusion controls, InfinityQS SPC integrations
- 🔄 Automation using C# scripts and services

### 🔒 What you'll (not) see here

Most of my code is closed-source, developed for clients in regulated industries.  
However, I'm working on sharing small utilities, code snippets, or tools that reflect what I do.
